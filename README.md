Lettres d'amour is an Oculus touch game for two players, played with only one headset and two Touch controllers. One player has the headset and a Touch controller, and they must throw their heart to the other player who need to catch it with the other Touch controller, 2 meters away. While they throw this virtual heart back and forth, the player with the headset can read out loud a love poem to their partner.
